Gusto has spent 10+ years building a smart and compliant payroll product, and let us be the first to tell you: it’s no easy task. That’s why we’ve created [Gusto Embedded Payroll](https://gusto.com/embedded-payroll)
— to help companies like you build and embed modern payroll and HR tools into your platforms in a fraction of the time it would take to build from scratch. With Embedded Payroll, you can provide a unique payroll experience tailored to the specific needs of your customers.

Gusto Embedded is not able to support all partner use cases at this time. There are commercial, security, and implementation conversations/ reviews required before partners can move to production. We welcome any developers that want to work with the demo environment but ask all developers to also [connect with our partnerships team](https://gusto-embedded-payroll.typeform.com/to/iomAQIj3?typeform-source=embedded.gusto.com)
 to discuss pre-approval before getting too deep into your build.
